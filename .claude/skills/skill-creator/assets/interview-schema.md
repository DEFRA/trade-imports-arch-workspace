# CREATE interview JSON shape

CREATE mode records interview answers into:

```
~/trade-imports-arch-workspace/.claude/workareas/skill-creator/<name>/decisions.json
```

The file is mutated atomically by `tools/skill-creator/interview-add-answer.sh` (one shape question per call). The final entry is consumed by `tools/skill-creator/scaffold-skill.sh` which materialises the skill directories under `.claude/skills/<name>/` and `tools/<name>/`.

## Schema

```jsonc
{
  "name": "skill-name", // kebab-case, 1-64 chars
  "started_at": "2026-05-26T...",
  "answered_at": null, // reserved — currently never set
  "scaffolded_at": null, // set when scaffold-skill.sh runs
  "answers": {
    "purpose": "One-line description of what the skill does.",
    "dependencies": {
      // Q2 — see patterns.md §9
      "resolution": "none", // "none" | "build" | "port" | "depend"
      "declared": [], // project names + non-baseline tools
      "justification": "", // the why, when resolution is "depend"
    },
    "state_shape": "json", // "json" | "prose"
    "dispatcher": true, // boolean
    "prebake": false, // boolean
    "fanout": {
      "enabled": true,
      "workers": ["AUDITOR"], // worker reference names (UPPER_CASE)
    },
    "walker": false, // boolean — N-item triage UX
    "helpers": [
      // names (no .sh suffix)
      "start-skill-creator",
      "scaffold-skill",
    ],
    "triggers": {
      "phrases": ["scaffold skill", "skill-create"],
      "disambiguation": "Distinct from /init (CLAUDE.md scaffolding) — this skill creates *workspace skills*.",
    },
  },
}
```

## Field rules

- `name` — drives every generated path. Must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$`. Set and validated by `start-skill-creator.sh` when it parses the trigger phrase; not an interview field.
- `dependencies` — see pattern 9. `resolution` records the project-overlap decision; `declared` tokens follow `agent-skills.md` → "Dependencies frontmatter" (projects + non-baseline tools). When `resolution` is `"depend"`, `declared` and `justification` are expected — `scaffold-skill.sh` warns and emits TODO markers when they are empty (never refuses).
- `state_shape` — see [`patterns.md`](../../../best-practices/skills/patterns.md) pattern 1. `json` triggers an `assets/<name>-schema.md` stub. A render helper is generated only if the `helpers` answer lists `render-<name>` (the interviewer prompts for it).
- `dispatcher` — see pattern 2. `true` triggers a `start-<name>.sh` stub.
- `prebake` — see pattern 3. `true` means the `helpers` answer should include `prepare-<name>` (the interviewer prompts for it); only the helpers list drives generation.
- `fanout.enabled` — see pattern 5. `true` requires at least one worker name; each becomes a `references/<NAME>.md` stub with a Bash-hygiene pointer at the top.
- `walker` — see pattern 7. Only valid when `state_shape == "json"` and there is a list of N items to triage. Validation in `interview-add-answer.sh`.
- `helpers` — see pattern 6. Each becomes a `tools/<name>/<helper>.sh` stub with a one-line TODO header. May be an empty array when the skill only reuses another domain's existing scripts (never list those here — same-domain collisions are refused before any write; another domain's name would just become a misleading stub).
- `triggers.disambiguation` — anti-pattern guard. The interview refuses to scaffold without a one-line statement of how the triggers differ from neighbouring skills (and from Claude Code's built-in `/init`).
