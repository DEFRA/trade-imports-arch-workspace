# PreToolUse guard for the Bash tool — blocks bypasses of the permission deny list
# that string-matching rules can't reliably catch.
#
# Incident that started this (2026-06-10): a denied `node scan.mjs` was re-run by
# copying the script into an allowlisted scripts/** path and chmod +x-ing it.
#
# Checks (each emits a deny + exit 0; a clean command exits 0 with no output
# and falls through to the normal allow/deny rules):
#   1. chmod in command position (any path form; behind sudo/timeout/etc; and via
#      find -exec / xargs) — adding execute bits is how a fresh file becomes runnable.
#   2. Path-invoked executables (./x, ~/x, /abs/x, dir/x) must be committed at HEAD
#      and unmodified in a git repo. Untracked/staged-only/edited/outside-a-repo
#      executables are denied — committing first forces a visible, reviewable step.
#   3. Secret-file reads by common readers (jq/grep/awk/file/cut/tr/strings/...) —
#      defence-in-depth for paths the Read() deny doesn't cover at the Bash layer.
#      (The OS sandbox is the real fix for this; this is a backstop.)
#   4. [EUDPA-221] git commit --no-verify — deny (bypasses pre-commit hooks/gates).
#   5. [EUDPA-221] git commit --amend when HEAD is already on a remote branch —
#      deny (rewriting pushed history).
#   6. [EUDPA-221] Foot-gun REDIRECTS via permissionDecision "deny" — each names
#      the sanctioned alternative in its reason, so an unattended agent reads it
#      and retries instead of stalling on an unanswerable "ask" (the prior design
#      hung subagents and spammed the user with prompts). A human keeps the `! cmd`
#      escape hatch for a genuine one-off. These carry no security weight — worst
#      case is a missed redirect, never a missed deny:
#        - a literal /Users/<user>/ path (use ~/ — the matcher treats them differently)
#        - raw `npx playwright test` (use `npm run test:local`)
#        - `npm --prefix` over the workspace symlink (canonicalize with cd && pwd -P)
#        - `&&` command chaining (one command per Bash call)
#      Force-push to main, chmod and rm -rf are already handled by settings.json's
#      deny list, so they are NOT re-implemented here (avoid duplicate/conflicting rules).
#
# Crucially, checks 1 and 2 are also applied INSIDE command substitutions
# ($(...) and backticks), which the permission rules and a naive segment split
# would miss — e.g. `echo $(./untracked.sh)`.
#
# Exemptions for check 2: node_modules (installed artifacts) and system prefixes.
# Bare commands (node, npm, git...) are left to the normal rules.
#
# stdin: PreToolUse hook JSON. Deny via hookSpecificOutput JSON, exit 0.

# `&&` command chaining — one command per Bash call (exit codes come back in the

# fire on nearly every command. Add them below only if you want the stricter rule.
#
# Only an UNQUOTED '&&' is shell chaining. A '&&' inside a quoted string is DATA,
# not an operator — e.g. `awk 'NR>=10 && NR<=20' f`, `jq 'select(.a && .b)'`,
# `grep -E 'x&&y'`. Matching the raw command string false-positives on all of
# those: under a DENY a wrongly-blocked one-liner cannot be click-approved, only
# reworded, so stripping quoted spans first is load-bearing, not cosmetic. ONE
# pass with an alternation, not two sequential passes: scanning left to right,
# whichever quote opens FIRST consumes through to its own closer, so a single-quoted
# span inside a double-quoted string (and vice versa) is handled correctly. Two
# sequential passes would strip the INNER single quotes first and mangle the outer
# double-quoted span, leaving '&&' residue that re-triggers the false positive.
# Style redirect, not a security control: worst case is a missed redirect, never a
# missed deny — the deny checks above/below still operate on the raw $CMD.
