# Workspace skill patterns — the 9-pattern checklist

Workspace skills under `~/trade-imports-arch-workspace/.claude/skills/`
share a small vocabulary of shapes. Each pattern is a judgment call,
not a default — the same skill rarely uses all of them. This doc is
the canonical reference cited by `skill-creator` (CREATE mode applies
it, AUDIT mode checks it) and by anyone reviewing a skill by hand.

Companion docs in this directory:

- [`anti-patterns.md`](anti-patterns.md) — known mis-applications,
  one entry per recurring trap.
- [`scaffold-template.md`](scaffold-template.md) — the `SKILL.md`
  skeleton CREATE mode emits.

## 1. State as canonical JSON (or not)

**Question:** What state does the skill produce, and is it queried by
downstream tooling?

- **JSON-canonical** if: there's a list of N items the skill or the
  user wants to filter / aggregate / mutate by helper (review items,
  upgrade packages, style findings). The walker pattern only makes
  sense over a JSON list.
- **Prose-canonical** if: the artifact is a narrative the user reads
  end-to-end and nothing queries (a plan, a Jira description, a
  refinement verdict report, a how-it-works doc). Don't promote to
  JSON.

**Pattern-fit trap:** it's tempting to add a JSON sidecar "for
queryability" everywhere. Only do it when there is an actual query.

## 2. Scripts call other scripts (single dispatcher)

**Question:** Does the LLM run multiple sequential deterministic
commands at session start (fetch X, then fetch Y, then mkdir Z, then
write W)? If yes, those collapse into one `start-<skill>.sh` (or
`prepare-<skill>.sh`) dispatcher.

The dispatcher's first stdout line is conventionally `MODE: <NAME>`
so the parent session knows which branch to follow.

**Pattern-fit trap:** if the workflow has only 1-2 deterministic
setup steps, a dispatcher is overkill. Inline in `SKILL.md` is fine.

## 3. Pre-baked context at prepare time

**Question:** Do workers (fan-out subagents) or the parent session
fetch the same data multiple times? If yes, bake it once at prepare-
time into `workareas/<skill>/<ticket>/...`.

Examples: per-repo best-practices bundles, PR diff caches, per-
version CHANGELOG sections.

**Pattern-fit trap:** don't pre-bake speculative context. Only what
the workflow actually reads on the hot path.

## 4. Bash call hygiene (LLM-typed commands)

The hard rules, all enforced via the project allowlist:

- One command per Bash call. No `&&` / `;` / `|` chains.
- No `cd <dir> && cmd` — use `-C` (git), `--prefix` (npm), `-f`
  (mvn), or direct paths to binaries
  (`<dir>/node_modules/.bin/...`).
- No `find ... -exec`. Use Glob + Read for find-then-read.
- No env vars (`$VAR`) in LLM-typed Bash — Claude Code prompts on
  expansion. Use literal
  `~/trade-imports-arch-workspace/...` paths.
- No `/Users/<you>/...` resolved form either — the matcher treats
  `~/trade-imports-arch-workspace/...` and its resolved `/Users/...` form
  as different prefixes.
- No `python3 -c` for JSON — use `jq` or workspace helpers.
- No `awk` / `sed -n` / `grep -n` to inspect files — use Read with
  offset+limit.
- Filter at the script (`--filter`, `--file`, `--repo` flag), not
  at the pipe.

This is workspace-wide; the full rule table lives in
[`agent-skills.md`](agent-skills.md) → "Bash call
hygiene". Skill prose must comply; AUDIT mode flags violations.

## 5. Hygiene pointer inside worker personas

**Question:** Does the skill fan out workers via `general-purpose`
Task subagents that follow `references/<NAME>.md`? If yes, every
worker reference file needs a one-line pointer to the canonical
source ([`agent-skills.md`](agent-skills.md) → "Bash
call hygiene") — subagents only read their reference file, not the
parent `SKILL.md`. Point, don't inline: the full rule table lives
once, canonically, so copies can't drift.

**Pattern-fit trap:** if the skill has no fan-out (parent session
follows the reference inline), even the pointer is optional. Add it
by default; skip only for very small single-file references.

## 6. Idempotent + atomic helpers

**Question:** Do helper scripts mutate state files?

- Atomic mutation = `jq ... > "$tmp" && mv "$tmp" "$file"` (or
  equivalent). Never partial-write.
- Coverage / completion gates check JSON fields, not file
  presence/non-emptiness (`jq -e '.verdict != null'`, not
  `[[ -s file ]]`).
- Where re-running might re-process already-done work, add a
  `reconciled_at` / `processed_at` marker and skip files where it's
  newer than the source's `updated_at`.

**Pattern-fit trap:** for single-shot single-author flows
(ticket-creator's `draft.md`), atomicity is over-engineering.
Recognise that.

## 7. Walker UX (for N-item triage)

**Question:** Does the skill produce a list of decisions the user
needs to make one-at-a-time (findings, items, packages)? If yes,
batch the presentation: present all items in one markdown block,
take a single batch keystroke string (`FFWFFWSSF`), apply via
parallel helper calls, slow-track only `D`s.

**Pattern-fit trap:** walkers are for N items. A single artifact (a
plan, a verdict, a draft) doesn't get a walker — natural-language
approval is right.

## 8. Allowlist coverage

**Question:** Does the skill introduce new `tools/<name>/` scripts?
If yes, `.claude/settings.json` must cover them — satisfied by
**either** the blanket prefix entry
`Bash(~/trade-imports-arch-workspace/.claude/tools/:*)` (the live
settings.json shape, covering every tools/ domain) **or** the
per-skill pair:

```
Bash(~/trade-imports-arch-workspace/.claude/tools/<name>/*)
Bash(~/trade-imports-arch-workspace/.claude/tools/<name>/*:*)
```

CREATE mode appends the per-skill pair only when no covering entry
exists; AUDIT mode flags a gap only when **neither** form is
present.

## 9. Dependencies

**Question:** Does the skill need anything that isn't bundled with
it — a workspace child project (`delivery-info-arch-tooling`,
`trade-imports-documentation`, ...) invoked at runtime, or a tool
beyond the workspace baseline (bash, curl, jq, git)?

The preference order is local-first, and it is upstream doctrine,
not just ours: the agentskills.io design center is a portable,
self-contained bundle ("most skills do not need" environment
requirements), and Anthropic's authoring guidance says to declare
dependencies rather than assume them, and to fail with helpful
errors rather than defer ("solve, don't defer"). When a new skill
overlaps functionality living in a child project: **port** the
logic into a `.claude/tools/<name>/` script, or **build** fresh,
before **depending** — a dependency makes the skill unusable on
machines without the child repo and couples it to that repo's
release cycle. Depending is allowed with an explicit recorded
justification (CREATE captures it; the `## Dependencies` body
section repeats it).

A well-formed depending skill carries (audit criteria, not
scaffold gates):

- `metadata.workspace-deps` frontmatter — a flat space-separated
  string of project names and non-baseline tools (format contract:
  `agent-skills.md` → "Dependencies frontmatter"; hard
  dependencies only — soft probes with graceful fallback are not
  declared).
- A `## Dependencies` body section stating the rationale and which
  features are used.
- A `description` that names the requirement — descriptions are
  pre-loaded every session, so this is the at-a-glance layer.
- A dispatcher pre-flight for every declared token — `MODE:
  BLOCKED` plus a `REASON` naming the remedy (dir check for
  projects, `command -v` for tools); never a raw downstream error.
- A clean `check-deps.sh` run (the workspace dependency doctor,
  wired into `make check`).

**Pattern-fit trap:** porting is not free either — copying an
actively-maintained pipeline (e.g. the tooling's Confluence ADF
conversion) forks it, and the fork rots. That is the shape of a
good justification for depending. A one-file jq transform is not.

## Pattern 10 (companion): Prose hygiene

The 9-pattern checklist focuses on shape. A tenth axis — prose
hygiene — runs orthogonally: even a correctly-shaped skill can carry
residue. AUDIT mode evaluates it but the deliverable is a **proposed
trim diff** (per-file deletions / collapses with line refs and short
rationale), not in-place edits. Trims land via a separate
implementation pass after the user reviews.

Trim categories to scan for:

- Historical / migration residue ("previously ...", "migrated
  from ...", "used to live at ..."). Commit log owns the rationale.
- Workspace-wide content duplicated per skill — collapse to a one-
  line reference to `agent-skills.md`.
- Hygiene pointer placement: workers spawned as `general-purpose`
  subagents need the one-line pointer to `agent-skills.md`
  (never a re-inlined full block); parent-loaded references inherit
  `SKILL.md`.
- Over-defensive bullets making the same point.
- Verbose rationale ("why" beyond a single phrase) — belongs in
  commits / audit plans, not skill prose.
- Stale references to scripts, paths, helpers that no longer exist.
- Forward-looking notes that aren't actionable.
- Repeated examples — pick one canonical location.

**Don't cut:** anti-pattern guardrails, worker spawn-prompt
templates, per-step instructions, decision rationale that informs
edge cases, cross-skill handoff prose, concrete file/line
citations.

## Cross-cutting conventions

- **Path conventions** — literal
  `~/trade-imports-arch-workspace/...` in LLM-typed
  prose. No env vars. See
  [`agent-skills.md`](agent-skills.md).
- **Worker fan-out** — `subagent_type: general-purpose` with a
  `Follow the instructions in ~/trade-imports-arch-workspace/.claude/skills/<owner>/references/<NAME>.md.`
  prompt. Not custom subagent types (they trigger the no-write
  guardrail).
- **Rendered markdown from JSON** — when state is JSON, the
  markdown view (e.g. `## Items` table) is generated by a
  `render-X.sh` helper. Hand-edits to the markdown are overwritten.
- **Cross-skill conventions** live under
  `best-practices/...` — single source of truth for things
  multiple skills cite.
